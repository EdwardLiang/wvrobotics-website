					<b>Year</b> : 2013 | <b>Challenge</b> : Block Party! | <b>Type</b> : FTC </p>
          <p>In <b>FTC Block Party!</b><sup>SM</sup>, two randomly selected teams are paired together as an Alliance to play one match against a second Alliance. Alliances are designated as either “Red” or “Blue.”</p> 
<p>Scoring Elements are 100, 2”, 2oz. plastic blocks. These blocks are yellow and can be used by all robots. At the center of the field is an assembly that includes a center bridge, pull-up bar, and two pendulums – each with four “pendulum goal baskets.” Below the pendulums are floor scoring areas. An Infrared (IR) Beacon is randomly placed under one of the four goals on each pendulum after robots are placed on the field, but before the Autonomous period starts. The field includes tape to aid robot navigation and to mark protected areas. Each Alliance also has its own flagpole in opposite corners of the field.
