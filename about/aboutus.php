<p><img src="assets/img/about/about_photo.jpg" alt="Our Team" style="float: right; padding-left: 10px;">Started as a small curious group in 2006, our club has now expanded to <a href="?id=members" title="Members">50+ members</a>.  In the beginning, the club participated in Botball, FTC, FirstVex and other various small competitions. In 2010, however, a new chapter began as more people joined robotics club. Various new members from veteran FRC teams transferred to Westview and enough interest was available to get the club's inaugural FRC season underway. From now on, the club's primary focus will be the FIRST Robotics Competition, and the team has transformed into a micro-corporation as members expand their knowledge into fields outside of programming. This year, we have started three FTC teams again as a pre-season event. The experience and knowledge from the FTC season flows into the FRC competition, so the team becomes more dynamic and experienced.</p><br>
<h3>Word from Our Founder</h3>

<h3>Structure of the Team</h3>
<p>Robotics is not your typical high school club. This club is most comparable to a small size independent company in which various tasks are done in order for the team to progress successfully. The president is in charge of overseeing all aspects of the team. The president, vice president, and other student leaders work together to create a network of different jobs for all the students to fill into. Each leader is responsible for their own specific section, such as Programming, Business or Mechanical Engineering. Each team leader, along with the students themselves, are responsible for the safety of all members. Every year, the team transacts tens of thousands of dollars. Unlike a typical high school club treasurer, our treasurer and business team commit a lot of time in raising money and finding corporate sponsors to help fund our robots.</p><br>
